I am a researcher focused on **reliable and interpretable AI systems for software engineering**, with an emphasis on **automated debugging and program repair**.

My work studies how **reasoning in large language models** can be **extracted, structured, and evaluated**, using **real-world bug reports**, **empirical benchmarking**, and **principled software-engineering methodology**.

I have worked at the intersection of **industry-scale debugging practice** (SAP Labs Korea) and **academic evaluation of debugging and repair systems** (UIUC with Prof. Darko Marinov), aiming to bridge **practical debugging workflows** with **rigorous reasoning-aware AI research**.
